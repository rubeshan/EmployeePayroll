Class Company
-------------
-------------
Then there is the class Company. It has the following instance variables:
- lengthOfYear: an integer
- currentDay: an integer
- numberOfEmployees: an integer
- profit: an integer
- employee: an array of Employee
------------------------------------------
Methods working on companies are:
- Company(int maxSize, int l): creates a company with 0 employees and an array of
length maxSize and lenghtOfYear = l
- employClerk(int i): creates a new clerk with all its variables as employee[i].
Variables are chosen randomly in a reasonable range. Clerks get 5 vacation days.
- addClerk() adds a clerk at the end of the employee array
- employDirector(int i): creates a new director with all its variables as employee[i].
Variables are chosen randomly in a reasonable range. Directors get 8 vacation
days.
- addClerk() adds a director at the end of the employee array
- dayStep: increases currentDay by 1. Tests whether currentDay % (lengthOfYear /
4) = 0. if yes, salaries are paid out. Tests for the end of the year. if yes,
gratifications are paid out and illDays are reset. Then it sets currentDay = 0. Tests
for birthdays. If yes, the salary is increased. Then it also tests whether it is time to
retire. Then, for all employees, it is randomly chosen whether to be ill, take free
or work. If clerks are ill too often they are fired. If an employee wants free but
vacationDay == 0, he must work.
